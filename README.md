# Multi-Port Service Deployment with Kubernetes and Azure DevOps Pipeline

The project is the development and automation of the deployment of a service that listens to HTTP, HTTPS, and custom TCP ports. We have created a Python application using Flask for HTTP/HTTPS and the socket standard library for TCP. The application is packaged in a Docker container, which allows it to be deployed to Kubernetes in Azure ACR. The process includes creating manifests for Kubernetes, configuring the Helm chart to simplify deployment, and integrating with Azure DevOps to automatically deploy and test services.
